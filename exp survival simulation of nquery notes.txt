0 activate parameters to step through simulation code
1 duration of study 28.25 months
2 use the ctrl hazard to simulate survival times (show them T1)
3 check we are on the right track, sampling variation of course
4 do the same for the intervention group
5 censoring (we will ignore as it is assumed non informative and so the same in both groups)
6 random uniform accrual time 0 and 18.5
7 add accrual to our random uniform to weibull events
8 make sure we censor if event is beyond study duration
9 make censoring time extremely large so they have no impact
10 observed time is min of censored and event (no effect here)
11 If event occurs >= duration time give 0 other wise 1
12 censoring variable
13 put into data frame...analyse
